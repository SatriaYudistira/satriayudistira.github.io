								<h1>My Journey</h1>
							</header>
							<div style="float: left; padding: 20px"><img src="images/S1.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="" /></div>
							<p>
								My Journey started when I was <b>16</b> years old, I have not finished high school yet
								but my parents want me to pursue my education abroad in the United States. Since my school does not require me to speak English.
								At that time, I am not fluent in English yet. I take an extra course outside of school to prepare for my IELTS in 2 months.
								I study really hard for it because I want to study abroad in the United States and do not want to take ESL(English as a Second Language) Classes.
								After 2 months, I took the IELTS test and I am so happy that I passed the test.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the United States, I study at Shoreline Community College from 2019-2020 to earn my Associate's Degree in Arts, Computer Science. 
								I facing a lot of difficulties there. I miss my parents and my friends and the society in Indonesia. I feel really homesick but I know I need to 
								thrive and keep going. At first, my major is Electrical Engineering, but after I took my first programming class; I fall in love with programming. 
								I changed my major after that class and I want to pursue my career in programming. I graduated from SCC with <b>Magna Cum Laude</b> and transfer to the University 
								of Wisconsin - Superior to earn my Bachelor’s degree.
							</p>
							<p>
								At UWS, I pursue my Bachelor of Science, Computer Science, and Math Minor from 2020 to 2022. Looking back, I learned a lot from algorithms and Data structure, 
								Computer Security, Web Programming, Assembly Language, Operating systems, and A lot of Math classes. Finally, I graduated from there on May 16 2022 at the age 
								of <b>20</b> years old.
							</p>
							<p>
								My journey taught me a lot of things, I learn that always thriving and doing our best is necessary for me to be successful in my class. I always try to do my best 
								and always do all assignments on time. It also teaches me to be a fast learner. Since I do not graduate from High school, I need to learn fast while I am taking 
								college courses so I can catch up with my peers. I’m also proud that not only I can catch up with my peers, but I also can do better than some of my peers. 
								My Journey does not end here yet, I will pursue my professional career in Software development or Data analytics. I will move forward to the next chapter of my 
								life.
